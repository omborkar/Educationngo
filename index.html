                1. Family background and support Family background is quite different for such children. They might not get same support as other students have and that will have huge psychological impact . <br> Sometimes their famil;y can not fulfill
                their resources need <br>
                <br> 2. Different socio-economic opportunities First generation school-goers might come from poor or lower middle class so less socio-economic opportunities are there for them as compared to other students. <br>
                <br> 3. Too much pressure on them First generation school-goers undergo a lot of pressure as their family has a lot of expectations from them. <br>
                <br> 4. Lack of guidance at home Nobody is able to solve the problems in their studies at home as other members of family are illiterate. In that case they have to rely largely on guidance at school. <br>
                <br> 5. Feeling of insecurity Approach toward them might be different that will cause insecure feeling among them.</p> <br>
